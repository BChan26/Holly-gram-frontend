The aim of this group project was to create a PERN full-stack application called "Hollygram", a Holiday Themed version of Instagram. This project uses React as a framework for the front-end, and Sequelize/Express with PostgreSQL for the back-end (https://github.com/agentlawler/Holly-gram-backend-2). Funtionality includes registration and login (with authentication), and full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) through the implementation of users, posts, and comments. Current data rendered on screen was created with @ngneat/falso.

# Challenges & Future Iterations
It is expected but still challenging when plans need to be tweaked, and you need to re-adjust your actionable items with the amount of time available. Our planned Component Hierarchy Diagram compared to our final product's were different, but ultimately still achieved the same goal. I enjoyed working on a team, but we realized very quickly that clear communication, agreed upon conventions, and sharing were the keys to making this application work. In a future iteration, it would have been good for us to have more specified tasks and ways of implementing them clearly defined on our Trello board. For example, f we missed a deadline, we should have pivoted earlier and adjusted accordingly.
